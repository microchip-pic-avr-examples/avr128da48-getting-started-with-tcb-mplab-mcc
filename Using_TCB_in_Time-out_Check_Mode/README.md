 # Using TCB in Time-Out Check Mode

This program shows how to configure the Timer/Counter Type B (TCB) in Time-out Check mode to measure the signal time generated by a GPIO. The time-out will be set to one second. If the time-out period is reached, the on board LED will toggle.

## Setup

The AVR128DA48 Curiosity Nano Development Board is used as test platform.

The following configurations must be made for this project:

Set the main clock to the Internal Ultra Low Power Oscillator at 32.768 kHz with no prescaler.

TCB3:
- System clock as clock source
- Configured in Periodic Time-out mode
- 1 second period (CCMP register = 0x7FFF)
- Event input is enabled
- Edge bit is set
- Capture interrupt is enabled

EVSYS:
- PC7 as event generator on CHANNEL2
- TCB0CAPT as event user on CHANNEL2

Global interrupts are enabled.

Pin PC7 is configured as input with pull-up enabled and pin PC6 is configured as output.


 |Pin                       | Configuration      |
 | :---------------------:  | :----------------: |
 | PC6 (LED)                | Digital Output     |
 | PC7 (Button)             | Digital Input      |

 ## Operation
1.  Connect the board to the PC.

2.  Open the Using_TCB_in_Time-out_Check_Mode.X project in MPLAB® X IDE.

3.  Set the Using_TCB_in_Time-out_Check_Mode.X project as main project. Right click on the project in the **Projects** tab and click **Set as Main Project**.
